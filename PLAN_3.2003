Plan of April 2003

1) Use Boost 1.30.0 and make sure library
still works for tsort and DAG cycle check

2) convert tsort application to .Call interface

3) get a better grip on how R data can be converted
to Boost graphs, and bring in a graph with weights
or distances

4) deploy their MST method and compare to R mstree

5) list the applications we want to have and try
to get a generic interface

6) consider building boost graphs in R by
manipulating pointer structures.  perhaps this
should be the highest priority!  boostGraph
as a descendant of graph
